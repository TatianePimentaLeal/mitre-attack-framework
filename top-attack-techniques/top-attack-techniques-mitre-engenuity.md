# TOP ATT&CK TECHNIQUES

https://top-attack-techniques.mitre-engenuity.org/



On the path to learning about Cybersecurity tools connected to Mitre, I studied the Top Att&ck Techniques website, from Mitre's Center for Threat Informed Defense.



According to their website:
"Using our [Methodology](https://top-attack-techniques.mitre-engenuity.org/methodology), along with an additional analysis of 22 ransomware groups over the past three years, the Center for Threat-Informed Defense created a Top 10 ATT&CK Techniques list for ransomware. This list can serve as a starting point for prioritizing ATT&CK techniques when planning to defend against ransomware attacks. This list is based on criteria that we identified as important and is not definitive for all defenders."



In their website home, they display a "Ransomware Top Ten List":

In 2023 and 2024, the number of ransomware attacks skyrocketed. According to research from Nordlocker, the top industries hit by ransomware include:

1. Manufacturing

2. Construction

3. Transportation/Logistics

4. Technology

5. Healthcare

And it is hard to keep up with the amount of changes in the invasion techniques and procedures, so, the Top Att&ch Techniques is one of the other cool tools we can use to help us to be ahead of threats.

They offer a calculator where you can input your concerns regarding the Cybersecurity health of your company, and then, receive a bunch of useful data to help you to review your defenses.



This is the Calculator initial screen:

There are filters with Operation Systems:

Detection Analysis tools:

NIST 800-53 and CIS Security Controls, along with other filters with a range from "none" to "high" to help you calibrate the results. This range is inversely proportional, so, if you choose "high" for your "Network Monitoring Components" you are informing the tool you already have a well-defined network monitoring, so the top techniques for it will be way below, and others with none or low range will be prioritized (as it is possible to infer that as they are low or non-existent, they will probably suffer from more possibility of attacks):

Once you have made your choices, you must click on "Generate Results", and the calculator will provide your top techniques:

It will allow preparing a narrowed strategy to remediate the lack of security, prepare a report, and have an appropriate data visualization to show to the security board from your company.
