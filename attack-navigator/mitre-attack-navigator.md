# [MITRE ATT&CKÂ® Navigator](http://attack.mitre.org/)

According to Mitre website (https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/):

The ATT&CK Navigator is a web-based tool for annotating and exploring ATT&CK matrices. It can be used to visualize defensive coverage, red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, and more.

Mitre ATT&CK tools are very important in the Cybersecurity world, for defensive,  offensive, and continuous threat detection (CTD).

This is the initial part of the site:

You can create a new layer by choosing the details of what you want.

In my study, I'm using the Enterprise ATT&CK framework. However, to ensure the displayed TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) align with your needs, it's important to select the specific Mitre ATT&CK version, domain, or other relevant options within the "More options" tab.

Once you choose your preferences, you will can hit the Enterprise ATT&CK button (or other, if according to what you need).

The Navigator will provide you with a matrix, where you can search for:

To give an example of the matrix use, I will search for the APT29 techniques. In the selection controls, click on the "search and multiselect" button, and on the right side of the screen type in "apt29", and then, pay attention to the options:

In the tab "Threat groups" it will appear a "(1)", click in the tab to see the additional options, and then click on "Select":

The APT29 items will appear as selected, and in order to help your visualization, you can add color to them by clicking on the background color in the "technique controls" tab above:

So, you will have a better visualization to show the technique used by APT29 group. It is very useful if you are creating a report regarding this threat group, how they work, and how you and your team can protect your company against this threat actor:

Att&ck Navigator provides a variety of tools to create a detailed matrix for studying, reporting, and other actions for Blue, Red, and Purple teams.
